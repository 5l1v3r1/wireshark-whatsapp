This is a plugin to help with WhatsApp protocol dissection. The protocol is
quite tricky and uses encryption, so at the moment the dissector is very basic.
Checked it using real traces taken from the qemu android emulator. Used to develop
a pidgin plugin for whatsapp successfully.

Hope you like it ;)
